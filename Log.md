## Day 44 [ 13/04.2024 ]
mobx-state-tree

Today I integrated mobx-state-tree with the app. It took me some time to find out that to utilize `useContext` I have to put the provider in the root _layout file. The phrase for google I was searching so long was `useContext with expo router`. 

‚è≠ next steps: 
- create categories and projects
- create models for records
- create timer feature
- persist data

‚è≠‚è≠ further steps:
- add actions to projects
- allow to plan actions during the week
  - for the begining - no exact time - just morning, afternoon, evening and order of action.
- actions appear on the list on main screen according to the plan

‚è≠‚è≠‚è≠ 
- export records to csv
- present nice graph

‚≠ê nice to have
- fancy tutorial
- bearable graphic design

üëÅ Vision:
When user first time opens the app the tutorial is started. The app is 'live creating' initial data with narrator describing what and why it's doing. 
1. Creating some basic categories
2. Creating projects for these categories 
3. a

For now it's called categories but I think I'd prefer 'Area'
