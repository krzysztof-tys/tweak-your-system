The project originates in my nerdy desire for overly specified statistics on my life mixed with ridiculus requirements no app could fulfill.

It's a mixture of various ideas and inspirations. 

### 📓 Journaling, daily notes, life tracking

If you're not familiar with journaling benefits I highly recommend investigating that subject.

### 🔁 OODA loop

John Boyd was a United States Air Force fighter pilot and military strategist who is best known for developing the OODA loop concept. He made significant contributions to the fields of military strategy and aerial combat tactics.\
The OODA loop is a decision-making framework comprising four stages: **Observe**, **Orient**, **Decide**, and **Act**. It emphasizes agility and adaptability in rapidly changing situations.

### 🕹️ One button UI

I just want to hit 'next' button and have everything saved

## 💡 How it works

### The root

You start with one simple activity.

The root concept is in planning - execution loop:

1. Observe - Where are you, what you want to do?
2. Orient - What are your options? What can you do?
3. Decide - Write down steps you're going take.
4. Act - execute. Hit 'next' and the app will timestamp every action accordingly to the plan.

You plan your action in the first place to be able to just hit 'next' during execution. It has couple of benefits. 
1. You're not distracted with writing down your action.
2. You're getting focused on the current step and don't end up as [Hal fixing a light bulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0).

### The journey

When you have a repeatable activity layed out in steps you can save it as **a routine**.

After you created some routines, you can plan your whole day using routines and activities.

After you run some routines, you can see statistics on your activities.

Then you can focus on one area, set goals and track progress.

## ⭐ Didn't get a thing?

Yeah, I know, the readme is quite chaotic. I'll clear that up, I want to focus on some coding for now.

But hey! 

If you find this project in any way helpful, insightful, informative, valuable, engaging or interesting consider showing your appreciation by giving it a star! Your support means a world to me. Thank you! 🔥

## 💃🕺 Wanna join?

Besides the dream of a perfect todo app, this projects serves a purpose of learning mobile app development. Let me know if you want to join me on that journey (wether or not you have any experience). I could use some help with:

- coding (react-native, android or ios; I have some crazy ideas for native components)
- graphic design
- marketing and copywriting 
- testing (both automatic and just using the app)
- anything else you'd like to do
