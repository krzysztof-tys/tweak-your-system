## 📜 Origin

The project originates in my nerdy desire for overly specified statistics on my life mixed with ridiculus requirements no app could fulfill.

It's a mixture of various ideas and inspirations. 

### 📓 Journaling, daily notes, life tracking

If you're not familiar with journaling benefits I highly recommend investigating that subject.

Don't know where to start?

### 🔁 OODA loop

John Boyd was a United States Air Force fighter pilot and military strategist who is best known for developing the OODA loop concept. He made significant contributions to the fields of military strategy and aerial combat tactics.\
The OODA loop is a decision-making framework comprising four stages: **Observe**, **Orient**, **Decide**, and **Act**. It emphasizes agility and adaptability in rapidly changing situations.

### 🕹️ One button UI

I just want to hit 'next' button and have everything saved

## 💡 How it works

### The root

You start with one simple activity.

The root concept is in planning - execution loop:

1. Observe - Where are you, what you want to do?
2. Orient - What are your options? What can you do?
3. Decide - Write down steps you're going take.
4. Act - execute. Hit 'next' and the app will timestamp every action accordingly to the plan.

You plan your action in the first place to be able to just hit 'next' during execution. It has couple of benefits. 
1. You're not distracted with writing down your action.
2. You're getting focused on the current step and don't end up as [Hal fixing a light bulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0).

### The journey

When you have a repeatable activity layed out in steps you can save it as **a routine**.

After you created some routines, you can plan your whole day using routines and activities.

After you run some routines, you can see statistics on your activities.

Then you can focus on one area, set goals and track progress.
