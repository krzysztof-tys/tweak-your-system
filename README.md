# Tweak Your System - a simple time tracker with remarkable effects
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Native-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB" />

Effortless, one button life tracker. Organize your life, build healthy habits and set systems for inevitable succes.

## Level 0 - Relaxed mode and Focused mode

Every other time tracking app is trying to measure everything you're doing.  
Which is exauhsting, especially if you're not used to this. 

Healthy change must occur slowly. It's not natural to switch from not really paying attention to constant focus on your every action. That's why Tweak Your System is designed to track only a small part of your life at the beginning. Take one goal or one habit and start with that. Later on when you will get used to planning and extended periods of focus you'll be able comfortably add more items to your schedule. 

You have two states of the app:
- Relaxed -> measures the time you're not in focused mode.
- Focused -> measures the time of activities you decided to track

## Level 1 - The Time Tracker (Focused mode)

Time Tracker is the heart of this application. But it's not an ordinary time tracker. It's heavily based on the OODA loop[^1]. It's designed in a way that is noninterruptive so that you can put your whole power into the activity you're doing.

1. Stop and think. Plan your immediate future. Divide your task into smaller steps. Let's say you want to play the guitar for an hour so you set up 4 steps: theory, warm-up, technique, jamm.
2. Press start, when you're ready.
3. The app will measure the time.
4. Press next when you proceed to the next action.
5. Press finish at the end of the last action.
6. The app will display the summary for all the steps.

The benefits: more focus (measuring the time), dividing task into smaller, more focus

## Level 2 - Routines

After you work some time with dividing your action into steps you'll notice you have some things that repeat and you'd like to save that. That's what you use routines for. A routine is simply a saved set of actions.

## Level 3 - History

Simple history with CSV export so that you can analyze your progress and compare it with your plan

## Level 4 - Designer

After you work some time with routines and create a bunch of them you'll notice you'd like to add some properties to them like category or expected duration. 

That's when Designer Mode comes into play so that you can create more complex routines or even whole projects.

## Level 5 - Planner 

Arrange your routines in the callendar.
